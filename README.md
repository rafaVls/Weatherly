# Fullstack-Weatherly

A fullstack weather app made with React, Typescript and Flask.

This App comes from my desire to learn fetching external data, setting up the
backend for such data, and working with React in a Typescript environment.

## Features

This is a weather app that uses OpenWeatherMap's API to get the user's forecast
for the current location on initial visit. Then, using Google's geolocation API,
the user can look for the forecast of a different location.

## Tech stack

- Flask.js - API calls, routes, and setting up the server.
- Typescript - This is the first time I implement Typescript on a project. The
  first programming language I learnt was C#, so Typescript felt pretty natural
  to me, and I'll definetely be using it more on future projects.
- React - All my components are functional components. I setup global state
  using React hooks and the context API.
- CSS Modules - I decided to go with CSS modules to set specific styles for
  each component.
